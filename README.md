# autolights

## Notes:
- [March 2020] Tried to do remote development with VS Code however, ArmV6 architecture is not supported by VS Code remote development.
-- Also realised cannot run rpI.GIO on local machine, because mac doesn't have access to the sensors.
-- Added requirements file

## TODO:
- Output currently prints 'something went wrong' frequently. This may be due to it being unable to connect to the lamp. Consider disabling the lamp for the short term.
- Push changes on the device to remote master, and ensure code is up-to-date, before making any future changes.
